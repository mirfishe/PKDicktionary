This page was last updated on 22/12/1995
<br>

<br>
This is a glossary of terms used by Philip K Dick. The description of each
<br>
term is based on my (or someone else's) best guess at the meaning, with
<br>
opinions, criticisms, bad jokes etc. Hopefully this approach will keep the
<br>
thing interesting, instead of it being just a dry, dusty description of
<br>
words that PKD used. It could be argued that some of the words here are not
<br>
exclusive to PKD, but I've included them because I think he put a spin on
<br>
the usual meaning. I'll also try to include some characters in the
<br>
Dicktionary, and even some comments on books and stories (I'll try not to
<br>
give the plot away too much, but be warned..)- at least until the whole
<br>
thing gets out of hand! What I'm trying to acheive is an overview of the
<br>
ideas that Dick grappled with- all of them, even the silly/trivial ones-
<br>
via the terms that he used to label them. That's why there's an entry on
<br>
Palmer Eldritch, but not Rick Deckard or Ragel Gumm. The PKD FAQ keeps
<br>
another lingo page here.
<br>

<br>
I'd be grateful if you'd mail me (Subject: DickWord) with any additions or
<br>
corrections to my definitions, any of PKD's books where you've encountered
<br>
a DickWord, or any other sources where you've encountered one. I'll try to
<br>
expand definitions wherever possible, but obviously this'll take time.
<br>
Apoligies for definitions like "an alien". Please return to this page
<br>
often- it'll get more interesting as it develops! In fact, it already has.
<br>

<br>
Each entry in the Dicktionary takes a standard form: The word or phrase in
<br>
capitals; definition and notes; PKD sources of the word (abbreviated into
<br>
numbers and initials); Each part is separated by a colon. Short stories are
<br>
initialled by the name of the part of five volume collection it appears in,
<br>
then a hyphen then the initials, so Beyond Lies the Wub, appearing in
<br>
Beyond Lies the Wub appears as BLTW-BLTW. The PKD FAQ Maintains a list of
<br>
books and short stories , which might be handy if you can't work out what
<br>
the initials mean....

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
ARTIFORG: An artificial organ. When mentioned in PT, they are no longer
<br>
made and are therefore reserved for the top brass in the government. In
<br>
NWFLY, they usually insert themselves. People can live for two hundred
<br>
years with artiforgs- like Virgil Ackerman, who was born (like PKD) in the
<br>
late 1920's but is still alive when Dr Sweetscent travels forward in time
<br>
to 2155: PT, NWFLY
<br>

<br>
AUTONOMIC: After the autonomic nervous system; It means Intelligent. PKD
<br>
used it to describe a range of things, e.g. In Ubik, there's an autonomic
<br>
pharmacy. U
<br>

<br>
BLUE CEPHALOPOD MAN: A comic book/superhero that turns out to be the source
<br>
of advanced weapons design: ZG
<br>

<br>
CONAPT: Apartment. Appears in lots of Phils work: U
<br>

<br>
DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP?: Novel. The bounty hunter Rick Deckard
<br>
is called in to retire a number of escaped replicants after they have
<br>
killed one of his collegues. Much of the novel concerns what it means to be
<br>
human and uses comparisions between humans, replicants and specials to
<br>
illuminate this subject. He also puts in a couple of machines (Mercer,
<br>
Empathy box) to reduce the distinction between humans and others even more.
<br>
Made into the film Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott. But you knew
<br>
that already.
<br>

<br>
EMPATHY BOX: A device used to merge with MERCER :DADOES
<br>

<br>
FLAPPLE: A flying car. Sometimes they are AUTONOMIC, sometimes thay aren't
<br>

<br>
FLURK: Expletive, as in "Flurk off, Zafsky!":U
<br>

<br>
FNUGGING: Expletive
<br>

<br>
FOODHEAD: Shithead. In CCW, where we eat our turds through our arses, we
<br>
shit out food from our mouths.:CCW
<br>

<br>
FRIPPING: Expletive:CCW
<br>

<br>
FURBLE: does it mean to come up witha clumsy inelegant solution to a
<br>
technical problem? kind of like kludge? Its like a combination of fumble
<br>
and burble and fudge.
<br>

<br>
GALACTIC POT HEALER: Novel . A man emigrates to another planet and gets
<br>
involved with a marine-based religion and the repeated printing of some
<br>
sort of bible. We meet the Glimmung and a Ganymedian Slime Mould. One of
<br>
Dicks best, but it's been a couple of years since I read it...
<br>

<br>
GANYMEDIAN SLIME MOULD: An intelligent being!:GPH
<br>

<br>
GLIMMUNG: An alien:GPH
<br>

<br>
GRASSED: Slang useage for being intoxicated: OFFF8
<br>

<br>
HOMEOPAPE: A newspaper that filters the news so it only shows what you are
<br>
interested in- these are beginning to exist now in the form of web robots.
<br>
There's a good description of what Phil imagined a homeopape to be in Ubik.
<br>
Along with many SF predictions, there are anachronisms in the way the thing
<br>
operates. The homeopape asks you what you want to read about. (the
<br>
forefront of our technology), and then prints it on paper. It's obvoius
<br>
that this was written before PCs were common....As an aside, I found it
<br>
amazing that the astronauts on Apollo 13 were using slide rules. This
<br>
illustrates a vast difference between the world of today and 30 years ago:
<br>
U
<br>

<br>
HOMOSIMULACRIC: In the manner of an android. Appears in Ubik even though
<br>
there are no Simulacra in the novel.:U
<br>

<br>
JJ-180: A highly addictive drug. when taken, you feel like you are in
<br>
control of objects, you 'know' them well and they serve you. Later in the
<br>
book, this effect is not mentioned again, and JJ-180 becomes a means of
<br>
travelling in time. As the drug wears off this control reverts to how you
<br>
are normally, and then things starts to get heavy and unfamiliar. You can;t
<br>
pick things up . Taken by Kathy Sweetscent, wife of Eric Sweetscent.
<br>
Supposed to be Made by Tijuana Fur and dye Co, but could be made by the
<br>
REEGS. Kathy was given the drug by secret agents from earth's ally
<br>
Lillistar. It turns out in the end that it was made on earth as a weapon
<br>
against our supposed allies, Lillistar. It is designed as a poison and was
<br>
intended to be put in the water supply. It is addictive after a single
<br>
exposure, causing damage to the liver and bloodstrean that cannot be cured
<br>
by artiforg replacement. JJ-180 allows the user to travel in time or to
<br>
parallel universes- a user is affected in one of 3 ways- he moves to the
<br>
future, the past or to parallel universes. There's a good bit where Kathy
<br>
persuades herself to take a second dose- a real insightinto how addiction
<br>
works. She says to herself. "I can't think straight, and I need to to
<br>
figure out how to get break my addiction. Therefore I need to take another
<br>
hit. After that I can think about how to break my addiction."...:NWFLY
<br>

<br>
KIBBLE: The chaos in the physical households of Deckard [sic] and Jack
<br>
Isadore [sic], but it also describes the emotional and spiritual chaos in
<br>
their lives. The kibble is the emotional and physical junk that builds up
<br>
in Dekkards life, it builds up so much it almost smoothers him. In the
<br>
novel he is forced to deal with all this kibble - his attitude to
<br>
replicants; his views on electric sheep,;his wife; Mercerism - and either
<br>
overcome it, or succumb to it. Note, however, that it's the intrusion of
<br>
Roy Batty into his life which forces this action and self examination upon
<br>
him. This theme pops up again in, for example, NWFLY; Here Dr. Eric
<br>
Sweetscent is also under a pile of Kibble, especially in relation to his
<br>
wife and relationship to his employer. The novel in some ways is his
<br>
journey to remove this kibble from his life, again forced upon him by the
<br>
intusion of President Molinari [sic] into his life..:DADOES, NWLY
<br>

<br>
KIPPLE: Exactly the same thing as kipple- there's confusion on the Dicklist
<br>
about the spelling. Ron Churgin says:
<br>

<br>
But it also reminds me of the ancient cartoon ( early 1900s New Yorker?)
<br>
showing an ardent and studious male suitor meaningfully inquiring of his
<br>
beloved sweet young thing:
<br>

<br>
He, passionately: "Do you like Kipling?"
<br>

<br>
She, innocently : "I don't know...I've never kippled."
<br>

<br>
LAND-O-SMILES: A brand of (hash?) cigarette
<br>

<br>
LIES INC.: Novel (1967). Originally called The Unteleported Man. A weird
<br>
one, possibly due to the way it was written, the style flips about all over
<br>
the place. People are leaving earth due to overcrowding using a teleport
<br>
device. Analogy of teleport device to the "showers" in concentration camps.
<br>
There is a plan to travel to the new planet by spaceship and physically
<br>
report back to earth, a round trip of eighteen years. Dick once again (3SPE
<br>
and others) plays with the vastness of space and the return of some sort of
<br>
saviour that goes wrong. On crossing via the teleport, the central
<br>
characters are shot with LSD darts and everthing goes completely crazy...:
<br>
UM
<br>

<br>
MERCER: An entity that humans "merge" with using an empathy box. By showing
<br>
that they are able to empathize with another person, they also show that
<br>
they are not androids. The grim gag here is that to prove you are human,
<br>
you have to empathise with a machine.:DADOES
<br>

<br>
MIN: to mimiaturise anything. Lots of spy-type devices are often minned in
<br>
PKD books
<br>

<br>
MOOD ORGAN: A device that one can set to change one's own moods. This means
<br>
that you are like a machine- if you are fed the right input you will
<br>
respond in a predictable way. And if your moods can be altered, what makes
<br>
you different from any other machine?:DADOES
<br>

<br>
MOREC: Moral Reclamation:TMWJ
<br>

<br>
MOUTH-HOLE: In CCW, where time flows backwards, this expletive is the
<br>
equivalent of our "Asshole". Think about it. See also FOODHEAD: CCW
<br>

<br>
NEXUS-6: The new and improved replicant, just introduced. Rush out and get
<br>
some for YOUR off-world mine.:DADOES
<br>

<br>
NEUTROLOGICS: higher-order cogitative methods used by the evolved NewMen.
<br>
Beyond comprehension of Unusuals, Under Men and Old Men: OFFF8
<br>

<br>
NOW WAIT FOR LAST YEAR: Nov. Earth is at war with the Reegs, and has an
<br>
ally in the Lillistar empire. We are losing the war and feel like our ally
<br>
is taking over our planet. We focus on Eric Sweetscent, Artiforg Surgeon
<br>
and his wife Kathy, an antiques procurer. There's an excellent chapter
<br>
about how bad their marriage is early on. Eric is originally employed by
<br>
Virgil Ackerman, head of Tijuana fur and dye Co, who use a martian organism
<br>
(name?) that can mimic objects (see also the Biltong). He goes to work for
<br>
Gino Molinari, President of earth, who is dying, but what of? Eric finds
<br>
out that Gino has been close to death many times, but appears to have the
<br>
organs of a nineteen year old. He suspects that his diseases are
<br>
sympathetic symptoms of the ilnesses of those around him. Gino's great
<br>
strength is his ability to feel absolute responsibility for his actions
<br>
(its also his weakness). Then a robant younger Gino Appears on TV, giving a
<br>
great speech. Eric is taken to a vault and shown another gino, this time
<br>
dead from an assasination..Meanwhile Kathy has become addicted to the drug
<br>
jj-180. Interesting few pages on how she convinces herself to take another
<br>
jj-180 hit. The second time she takes it, she finds that she and the
<br>
autonomic cab she is in travels back in time from 2055 to 1935. Kathy is an
<br>
expert on Wash-35, the martian replica of 1935 Washington DC which her
<br>
Artiforg-supported boss Virgil Ackerman maintains as a hobby. Note that
<br>
reality itself is altered by the drug- a constant PKD theme- . She posts a
<br>
transistor from the cabs radio to the boy Ackerman, returns to the cab and
<br>
waits for the drug to wear off. This fails because she was (?) in a
<br>
parallel universe. The Dicklist has recently (12/95) discussed the
<br>
similarities of Molinari to Mussolini. In this context, the Lillistar
<br>
empire becomes the Nazi Axis, and the Reegs become the allies.
<br>

<br>
OCCIFER: Joel Smith was tickled to find that the police title is "Occifer".
<br>
This is definitely not a typo and pops up frequently.:OFF8
<br>

<br>
PAY THE PRINTER: We meet the biltong, which copies objext almost perfectly.
<br>
Versions of the Biltong subsequently pop up in many stories. We find that
<br>
if we can get something for free, we don't bother keeping the skills we
<br>
needed before we could get it for free, and stagnate. This is Luddism in
<br>
it's most powerful form...PTP-SV?
<br>

<br>
PENULTIMATE TRUTH: Novel: During a nuclear war, everyone has to live in
<br>
underground TANKS to escape contamination. One of the tanks needs an
<br>
ARTIFORG, so a volunteer rises to the surface to find that there is no war
<br>
anymore. A 1984-type book, dealing with the power of misinformation. Can't
<br>
remember what PT actually is,though. PT based on a series of early short
<br>
stories dealing with the same scenario (BLTW-TD; SV-SV). Note that the
<br>
Hebrew for tooth is "shin", which is also the penultimate letter of the
<br>
Hebrew alphabet. Is PT a play on "The penultimate tooth"?
<br>

<br>
PRECOG: A mutant with precognition powers :3SPE:
<br>

<br>
PROXER: An alien from Proxima centauri :3SPE:
<br>

<br>
PUDDINGED: Malformed. Said of objects made by the Biltong that began to
<br>
decay.PTP-SV
<br>

<br>
REEGS: Insectoid aliens that are supposed to be our enemies but are
<br>
actually quite nice. They communicate with hemans via an electronic
<br>
decoding box: NWFLY.
<br>

<br>
REPLICANTS: Androids. They are used by humans as slave labor on other
<br>
planets. Sometimes they escape and get down to Earth where they are hunted
<br>
down by bounty hunters. One distinguishing feature of replicants compared
<br>
to humans is that they are supposedly not able to empathize with others:
<br>
DADOES
<br>

<br>
RETIRE: Kill (used of escaped replicants). You can't say you're killing
<br>
them because then you would have to admit that they were once alive. And if
<br>
they were alive, they were definitley sentient beings....:DADOES
<br>

<br>
SCENARA: Opium-based drug, named for Wade Scenara the drug's inventor.
<br>
:OFFF8
<br>

<br>
SEMI-MATTER: Substance between matter and antimatter which can absorb
<br>
either. Morgo the Frolixian in OFFF8 claimed ot be made of this: OFFF8
<br>

<br>
SKIN: A form of currency- the skin of a fungus- the only thing that cannot
<br>
be reproduced by replicating organisms (We met these organisms in a short
<br>
story (in vol 2 I think)), and therefore the only thing that can be used as
<br>
money. Must get awful smelly...:3SPE
<br>

<br>
SPECIALS: Humans who's genes have deteriorated due to radiation. They are
<br>
considered subhuman by non-specials. They are not allowed to emigrate
<br>
off-planet. A typical Dickian Underclass - note that this underclass is
<br>
called SPECIAL and not disabled/mutants etc- very PC! :DADOES
<br>

<br>
SQUIB: a kind of hover car. It's steered with a tiller and has a boat-like
<br>
description: OFF8
<br>

<br>
SWIBBLE: some kind of device to control the 'politically correct behaviour'
<br>
of citizens. It is "an artifically evolved telpathic metazoan." It's
<br>
purpose was to stop war by ensuring that everyone maintained the same
<br>
ideology, that everyone agreed. The last war was fought between those who
<br>
wanted swibbles and those who didn't. When the main character asks the
<br>
wrongly directed time-traveled repairman what happened to those who lost
<br>
the war, the answer is wonderfully simple, "Why," the repairman said
<br>
gently, "the swibbles got them.":Service Call, vol 4.
<br>

<br>
TANK: Vast underground container, acting as a refuge from nuclear
<br>
holocaust:PT
<br>

<br>
THREE STIGMATA OF PALMER ELDRITCH: Novel (1962), widely regarded as one of
<br>
Dick's best, but I'm not so sure. Earth is overcrowded and (due to global
<br>
warming?) overheating. Citizens are drafted to Mars (unless they can prove
<br>
they are insane) to reduce the population on earth. Life is so dreadful on
<br>
Mars that the colonists spend much time in a drug-induced fantasy world:
<br>
Perky Pat Land. Palmer Eldritch returns from Proxima with a new and better
<br>
drug. The trouble is, Palmer has the power to invade the hallucination and
<br>
control it. It turns out that PE encountered The creator of the universe
<br>
floating between Proxima and earth. The creator invaded him and came to
<br>
earth to see what was going on. Dick tries to show us that if there is a
<br>
god, it behaves in a way that we can't hope to understand.The three
<br>
Stigmata are the physical alterations to Eldritch's body- metal teeth,
<br>
Metal eyes with slit-lenses, and a metal arm. The themes are excellent but
<br>
I found the ending a bit of an anticlimax.
<br>

<br>
TIRE REGROOVING: Process of using a hot iron to melt deeper grooves into
<br>
the bodies of already bald tires. Occupation of Nick Appleton in OFFF8.
<br>
Outlawed by Gram in this novel: OFFF8
<br>

<br>
UBIK:Nov: Initially seems to the standard mutie/anti mutie type conflict
<br>
thing (dealt with in a short story by P before, in one of the first three
<br>
vols- was it the Golden Man? ) But this is really used as a device to
<br>
introduce a lot of people then kill them. What it really deals with is the
<br>
after-life. If people are frozen quickly enough after death, cephalic
<br>
activity can be picked up, allowing communication with the deceased for a
<br>
few days (which can be spun out, hour at a time for many years). People in
<br>
this state are said to be half-lifers. A group of people, lured to the moon
<br>
and killed are placed in cold storage (we don't know this). What then
<br>
happens is everything starts to decay, everything except for strange
<br>
messages from someone starts to decay or become old. The messages are from
<br>
someone trying to get in touch with them while they are in half life, and
<br>
the decay is caused by a gradual cessation of cephalic activity. Ubik
<br>
itself is a spray to stop objects regressing to a form they had in earlier
<br>
time, e.g. a tv goes back to a valve radio. Trouble is, Ubik itself
<br>
regresses to a point where it's magic ingredient isn't there. It's a short
<br>
form of ubiquity. Note also the bizarre modes of dress in the book. I'd
<br>
love to see these illustrated..:U
<br>

<br>
UNTELEPORTED MAN: Novel: Early version of what became Lies, Inc.
<br>

<br>
VOIGT-KAMPFF TEST: The test that is used to differentiate replicants from
<br>
real human beings.:DADOES
<br>

<br>
WES-DEM: Western Democracies
<br>

<br>
WUB: An alien/Martian: BLTW-BLTW
<br>

<br>
WUBFUR: A commonly encountered expensive material (used as mink would be
<br>
used, I guess). A wub is a creature that invades/takes the form of (can't
<br>
remember) other creatures, so it shouldn't really have a "fur"...this is a
<br>
typical PKD in-joke.... :3SPE
<br>

<br>
YANCY: President. And when he died, they made a robot to do his job: PT
<br>

<br>
ZAP GUN: Novel (1965), not a popular Dick book, but I thoroughly enjoyed
<br>
it. Recollection is hazy but; Weapons are literally "dreamed up" in a
<br>
phoney war between east and west. Dick focuses on the insecurities of the
<br>
dreamers about losing their powers and being one of the ordinary people.
<br>
East and West must unite to combat an alien foe that begins to destroy
<br>
cities all over earth. Interesting link to a story "War Veteran" in vol 3
<br>
of collected short tales- Veteran turns up who turns out to be from a
<br>
future war. The weapons dreamers discover that all the weapons are
<br>
appearing in old comic books. Not the most highbrow of Dicks works, but the
<br>
gallows humour is superb..
