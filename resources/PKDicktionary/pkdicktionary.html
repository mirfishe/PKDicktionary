<h2>About this file</h2>
<p>
I am not the author of this file. That person was Simon Hickinbotham, who
originally maintained it at his homepage at the University of York. Since it
is no longer extant except for a few bootleg copies floating about on the
Web, it's clear that he no longer has the time to maintain it. So, in his
stead, I have given it a new home and cleaned it up a bit. I am slowly going
through it to add proper inter-item hyperlinking for each reference, and
cleaning up a few typos, so if this note is still here, I haven't finished
yet. Feel free to <a href="/email.html">email</a> me any comments you may have.
</p>
<p>
And now, over to Simon:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This is a glossary of terms used by <a href="http://www.philipkdick.com/">Philip
K Dick</a> (hereafter referred to as PKD). The description of each term is
based on my (or someone else's) best guess at the meaning, with opinions,
criticisms, bad jokes etc. Hopefully this approach will keep the thing
interesting, instead of it being just a dry, dusty description of words
that PKD used. It could be argued that some of the words here are not
exclusive to PKD, but I've included them because I think he put a spin on
the usual meaning. What I'm trying to achieve is an overview of the ideas
that Dick grappled with - all of them, even the silly/trivial ones - via the
terms that he used to label them. 
</p>
<p>
To save my blunt and bloody fingers, I've found it necessary to provide a
reference section so I don't keep having to type out the full title of a PKD
work. References to works where a term is used are represented by a code: A
number refers to the year the work was first published, followed by a sensible
four-letter reduction of the title of the work. I'm trying to give brief
descriptions of each story I refer to - but sometimes I ramble on a bit!

<strong>AGE OF WASTE</strong><br />
The time before the war in <a href="#56jape">56JAPE</a>. Note that Mr Spock refers to the 20th century in this way in the film Star Trek IV. Coincidence?
</p>
<p>
<strong>ALBEMUTH</strong> (<a href="#85rafa">85RAFA</a>)<br />
To quote PKD:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In a previous "dream" (truly, a vision experience) I saw the mysterious word
ALBEMUTH. Maybe I mentioned this. They let me take a crack at decoding it on my
own. Here's what I got: Al is a common prefix for star names, it being from
the Arabic meaning "the." So ALBEMUTH is a star. "albe" is close to "alba"
which is L. for "white." So we have "the white." The star we call FOMALHAUT means
"Whale's Mouth." "Muth" is close in sound to "mouth." MOBY-DICK was called "The
great white whale." So ALBEMUTH means "the great white way," which is "Broadway," so it
can be finally decyphered as: "The Milky Way." Or. "A star in the Milky Way." 
Formalhaut is in the Pisces Constellation. Pisces means "fish." The fish sign was the
original secret sign of the Christians. Thus ALBEMUTH is a cypher for
Jesus.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Not much more to say about this other than it makes no sense at all. Surely no one would find
this "deciphering" very convincing -- perhaps not even Phil. It looks like he must have
already decided that "ALBEMUTH" did mean "JESUS" and then constructed this bogus logic
to reach that answer. If you are prepared to root through three separate and dissimilar
languages (Arabic, Latin and English -- not to mention American slang) you can
ultimately reach any conclusion you want. Incidentally, the English word "mouth"
actually derives from the Old English word "muth." Phil must have missed that bit of
historical linguistic lore. Probably used an abridged dictionary.

<strong>ANDERSON THEORY</strong><br />
Identifies each sub-form of 'phrenia with a sub-form of religion. The primary form is heliocentric (sun worship), where the sun is seen as the patients father. Other forms include Magna mater 'phrenia. <a href="#68weby">68WEBY</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>ANDROID</strong><br />
An artificial human <a href="#55solo">55SOLO</a>. In <a href="#68dado">68DADO</a> they are used by humans as slave labor on other planets. Sometimes they escape and get down to Earth where they are killed by bounty hunters. Technology is so advanced that the only distinguishing feature of androids compared to humans is that they are (supposedly) not able to empathize with others.

<strong>ANT TANK</strong><br />
Vast underground container, acting as a refuge from nuclear holocaust, the ant part is a contraction of
antiseptic. (<a href="#64pent">64PENT</a>)

<p>
<strong>AQUASOMA 3</strong><br />
A previous polyencephalic world, where we were all dolphin-like mammals in warm seas. Not at all like
Delmak-O. (<a href="#70maze">70MAZE</a>) 
</p>
<p>
<strong>ARTIFORG</strong><br />
An artificial organ. When mentioned in <a href="#64pent">64PENT</a>, they are no longer made and are therefore reserved for the top brass in the government. In <a href="#66nwly">66NWLY</a>, they usually insert themselves. People can live for two hundred years with artiforgs- like Virgil Ackerman, who was born (like PKD) in the late 1920's but is still alive when Dr Sweetscent travels forward in time to 2155.

<p>
<strong>AUTONOMIC</strong><br />
After the autonomic nervous system; It means Intelligent. PKD used it to describe a range of things, e.g. In <a href="#69ubik">69UBIK</a>, there's an autonomic pharmacy. I think that PKD only used autonomic where (sometimes a very low level of) intelligence is implied. But that's only my opinion. There was an interesting article in New Scientist recently (1995?), where if the 'right' amount of noise is introduced to artificial neural networks, they become capable of creative thought. Phil set his stories in worlds where science had defined such vague concepts as intelligence and creativity, worked out how to bottle such things, and put them into machines. <a href="#65stig">65STIG</a>

<strong>BOTTLE</strong><br />
Twitched to select the number of a power card, the owner of which becomes Quizmaster. Twitched at regular intervals unless a new Quizmaster is needed. Not really a bottle, but a complex mechanism based on Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle - the movement of subatomic particles, using a Plimp board. It's a "socialised instrument of chance", and part of the whole M-Game. The botle chooses random individuals at random intervals. <a href="#55solo">55SOLO</a>

<strong>BRAIN BASHER</strong><br />

</p>
<p>
<strong>BSR</strong> (<a href="#55solo">55SOLO</a>)<br />
Bad Security Risk.
</p>
<p>
<strong>BUILDING</strong><br />
Ominous structure that exists outside the colonists' compound in <a href="#70maze">70MAZE</a>. It's grey and large - a cube almost with odd spires from heat sources. There's activity (machinery) within - "a factory?". Tiny animated replicas of the building invade the compound, projecting tiny cannons and firing beams. When looked at under a microscope, these miniatures are inscribed "made at Terra 35082R". The real building is protected by a decoy phantasm device- If you don't approach it, it reveals itself. There's a sign above the door that entices the reader in. Susie Smart thinks the sign says WHIPPERY. Seth Morely ready WINERY - a wine tasting room. Maggie Walsh reads WITTERY - a room of absolute knowledge. Wade Fraser reads STOPPERY - where the mentally ill are "stopped". Mary Morley (Seth's spiteful wife) reads WITCHERY - where control of people through formulas and incantations are learnt. Ignatz Thugg reads HIPPERY HOPPERY - "where people hop onto animals for youknowwhat". Betty Jo Berm reads MEKISSERY - mekkis is the hittite word for power - the font of the universe. Each reader believes that only he/she should enter - the others wouldn't understand. Seth Morley suspects later that the building is an asylum that they all escaped from (but that would be too much like <a href="#64clan">64CLAN</a>). 
It seems that the building is the major manifestation of the unease among the ships crew. It wasn't designed into Delmak-O deliberately. That's why it has all these dream-like qualities associated with it. As Delmak-O disintegrates, Seth Moley sees everyone returning to the building, (and therefore their own psychoses?), but the building disintegrates before they enter, just as they are crossing a river. I expected the role of the building to be explained in more depth later in the book, but it's just described as the Boeing plant on Proxima 10 where the Persus 9 was built, and where the crew boarded it. I suspect that PKD originally planned to make more of it than that.

<strong>CHALLENGE CONVENTION</strong> (<a href="#55solo">55SOLO</a>)<br />
A means of challenging the quizmaster that needs to be set up to select a new assassin. The rule is "one assassin at a time, chosen by public convention" - or a violation has to be proved. You can arrange conventions to name the assassin of your choice. Teeps find out every strategy - they discover you as soon as you begin playing - so they force you to act randomly. Assasins lose the M-Game to teeps because there are 80 teeps to one assassin - even so occasionally an assassin wins. If you break the rules of the Convention you're out of the game for life.

They tend to be able to squeeze into people's personal spaces, though car windows, doors and so on. One of the characters in <a href="#64sima">64SIMA</a> develops a psychotic episode in which he believes he has a terrible body odor which nearly debilitates him after hearing one of these commercials.

<strong>DARK-HAIRED GIRL</strong><br />
PKD is supposed to have an obsession with a "dark-haired girl", supposed by some to be his dead twin sister or an amalgam of his wives, or the particular appearence of girls that PKD was attracted to. It's odd that this philosophical writer was attracted to "Dark haired girls" regardless of their personality - is this why DHGs are often spiteful evil and unpredictable?. I've not read of any instances where PKD says "yes, I put dark-haired girls in my books when I want a character based on..." though. In <a href="#56jape">56JAPE</a> we see a brief early DHG as Gretchen Malparto. In <a href="#64wdms">64WDMS</a>, the DHG is the grand-daughter of a dead man who's ghostly thoughts are picked up by a radio telescope. She is an ex-drug addict who had a near-death experience herself. In <a href="#68weby">68WEBY</a> it's Pris Frauenzimmer, a particularly dark DHG, who loathes Luois Rosen, her besotted admirer who even hallucinates about her. In <a href="#77scan">77SCAN</a>, the DHG is Donna the drug dealer, whom Bob Arctor loves but is "too ugly" to have a hope with. Donna steals everything she can lay her hands on and finds ingenious ways of making money from her thefts.

Tony Dunklewelt saw the FD in his trances, and clamed that there was a god-above-god that included the FD as well as the three conventional forms of god.

In <a href="#64wdms">64WDMS</a> and <a href="#69ubik">69UBIK</a>. When you die, it's not the end. If you are placed in cold-pac, the death throes of your brain can be picked up by the living, allowing you to communicate. Since your brain signals decay after death, you only have a limited amount of time in half-life, but this time can be spun out if you are revived for communication rarely.

<strong>HOMEOPAPE</strong><br />
A newspaper that filters the news so it only shows what you are interested in- these are beginning to exist now in the form of web robots.

<strong>INTERCESSOR</strong><br />
A part of the polyencephalic theology of <a href="#70maze">70MAZE</a>. He is a Manifestation of the Deity that can stand in for us collectively. The Intercessor arose as a result of the struggle between the Deity and the Form Destroyer, which took place over a very long time. The Intercessor offered himself as sacrifice by which The Curse could be partially nullified. This satisfied the Deity that this manifestation of Himself had been a partial victory. The Deity died and re-manifested himself to indicate that he had overcome the curse and hence death. Having done this, he moved up through concentric circles back to God himself. Since then, everything's happened so fast. Now that we are in the Specktowsky period it's easy to contact one of the Manifestations - this time is different from the first 2000 years since the Intercessor appeared. The Curse is lifted through him - we are released from our world and condition and see reality as it really is, without the modes of perception of space and time. In Maggie Walsh's post-polyencephalic-death hallucination, the Intercessor flutters up from the hell-world and Maggie drifts away from the red smoky lights of the "wrong wombs", carried by the warm wind of the Intercessor to a powerful flickering yellow light. The Intercessor is the only Manifestation to appear in the real world, not the polyencephalic construct in which most of the events of the novel take place. He appears to Seth Morely as he is about to kill himself and takes Seth away to be a desert plant, asleep but "aware of the sun and myself". I suppose the hint here is that the theology that was invented for Delmak-O is the theology of the real world.

<strong>JJ-180</strong><br />
A highly addictive drug, the nature of which alters throughout <a href="#66nwly">66NWLY</a>. Early in the novel, it makes you feel like you are in control of objects; you 'know' them well and they serve you. As the drug wears off this control reverts to how you are normally, and then things starts to get heavy and unfamiliar. You can't pick things up . It is first taken by Kathy Sweetscent, wife of Eric Sweetscent. The supposed manufacturer of the drug changes as well. At first, it is supposed to be Made by Tijuana Fur and dye Co, but then it could be made by the Reegs. Then we suspect that Kathy was given the drug by secret agents from Lillistar. It turns out in the end that it was made on earth as a weapon AGAINST Lillistar. It is designed as a poison and was intended to be put in the water supply. It is addictive after a single exposure, causing damage to the liver and bloodstream that cannot be cured by artiforg replacement. Later in the book JJ-180 becomes a means of traveling in time, and still later we find that it allows the user to travel to parallel universes as well.

They whirr as they surrender their tapes to committee representatives. The idea is that they only report what they see, so you are safe from hysterical heresay, malice and paranoia. But when you are caught, there is certainty about your actions - it is up to the courts to decide whether those actions were criminal.

<strong>KIPPLE</strong><br />
The physical and emotional junk in the lives and households of Deckard and Jack Isadore in <a href="#68dado">68DADO</a>. It builds up so much it almost smoothers Deckard, so he is forced to deal with all this kipple - his attitude to androids; his views on electric sheep; his wife; Mercerism - and either overcome it, or succumb to it. Note, however, that it's the intrusion of Roy Baty into his life which forces this action and self examination upon him. This theme pops up again for example in <a href="#66nwly">66NWLY</a>; Here Dr. Eric Sweetscent is also under a pile of kipple, especially in relation to his wife and relationship to his employer. The novel in some ways is his journey to remove this kipple from his life, again forced upon him by the intrusion of President Molinari into his life. Kipple is also mentioned more flippantly in 69GAPH. Joe Fernwright is on the shore of Mare Nostrum, where Glimmung is submerged and possibly dead. Phrases idly run through Joe's
head:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Do you like Yeats?" "I don't know, I've never had any." "Do you like Kipling?" "I don't know, I've never kippled."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is in reference to the ancient cartoon ( early 1900s New Yorker?), one of the most popular cartoons of all time. And in
<a href="#70maze">70MAZE</a>: "I'll pile her stuff outside and then get mine aboard. I'm under no mandate to load her kipple". James Tiptree Jr. has also used the term.

<strong>M-GAME</strong> (<a href="#55solo">55SOLO</a>)<br />
minimax game; Minimax is the method of surviving the great game of life - invented by 20th century mathematicians Von Neumann and Morgenstern. The method was used in WWII, Korea and the Final War and became the basis of government in 2.5 centuries. It places great emphasis on the Aristotlean Golden Mean. Social situations are analogous to strategy games like poker. So a system for poker will work like a system for society. If you act randomly, you avoid acting foolishly under the deception of your opponents. You can then use regular statistical methods to succeed. Opponents are then forced to give up deception and adopt a rational proceedure. There are two parts to the M-Game

<strong>PRESTON SOCIETY</strong> (<a href="#55solo">55SOLO</a>)<br />
The whole Prestion thing in <a href="#55solo">55SOLO</a> shifts about so much it's difficult to describe coherently ...John Preston wrote crazed/prophetic books about a 10th planet in our solar system called "Flame Disc". Preston was an odd-ball astronomer - when observations couldn't find this planet, he set off to look for it in his ship and died. The goal of the society is to send a ship beyond the "colony planets" - beyond the regions controlled by the Directorate. And to find Flame Disc. Next to the society building is the crypt of Preston, a dummy of whom is sealed in a plasti-cube there. The Plasti-cube is vacuum-sealed - if opened (and if Preston's corpse was actually in there), Preston's body would be pulverised. The real Preston is alive on Flame Disc. He gives a clue about this in his books (one is called "Unicorn") when he speaks of the voices that will guide us. The voices speak in your mind - this happens even though when people arrive at Flame Disc Preston would be 150ish. Preston really just wanted a society where everyone had a real chance of winning. On Flame disc, there's a spherical building that contains a Preston in a nourishing suspension bath. The sphere is one of 1000's of buouys acting as guides to flame disc. put there by Preston. The bath is a volatile substance to project a vid image onto the Preston replica. The real Preston died a few years after finding Flame Disc. See what I mean about being vague?

<p>
<strong>REXEROID</strong> (<a href="#55solo">55SOLO</a>)<br />

</p>
<p>
<strong>SCRAMBLE SUIT</strong><br />
worn by Bob Arctor in <a href="#77scan">77SCAN</a> as a means of concealing his identity whilst giving a lecture. The scramble suit is a thin membrane which displays different features of different faces etc. to blur your own features. The face of it's inventor appears once every twenty (?) odd years.
</p>
<p>
<strong>SEMI-MATTER</strong><br />
Substance between matter and anti-matter which
can absorb either. Morgo the Frolixian in 70OFFF claimed to be made of this.

<strong>SHAVING WAND</strong><br />
An edufacture building project in <a href="#56jape">56JAPE</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>SIMULACRUM</strong><br />
A Synthetic human "I always thought of as a
robot" in <a href="#68weby">68WEBY</a>. Used for Lunar exploration originally, but if the ruling
monad guidance system is fed an entire body of data pertaining to a character (UCLA
transcribes the data into instruction punch-tape for you), then a Simulacra can
take on the personality of that person. A prototype of Edwin M Stanton cost 6000
dollars to build. Then they built an Abraham Lincoln. Sam K Barrows, entrepreneur
wanted to populate new towns on the moon with simulacra so that the first human
colonists wouldn't be lonely (see also famnexdo). 
</p>
<p>
<strong>SKIN</strong><br />
A form of currency- the skin of a fungus- the only thing that cannot be reproduced by replicating organisms (see printers), and therefore the only thing that can be used as money. Must get awful smelly...<a href="#65stig">65STIG</a>

<strong>SPECIALS</strong><br />
Humans who's genes have deteriorated due to radiation in <a href="#68dado">68DADO</a>. They are considered sub-human by non-specials and are not allowed to emigrate off-planet. A typical Dickian Underclass - note that this underclass is called SPECIAL and not disabled/mutants etc- very PC! In <a href="#68weby">68WEBY</a>, Special birth persons are similar radioactive mutants - Chester Rosen's eyes and mouth have swapped places for example. Sometimes an embryo is born in pieces - a jaw, an arm, teeth, fingers, like a kit that no glue in the world would stick together. Eeeeeugh!
</p>
<p>
<strong>SPECKTOWSKY</strong><br />
Egon Specktowsky was the captain of the Persus 9, but was killed in the unspecified accident which stranded the ship forever <a href="#70maze">70MAZE</a>. His crew name him as the author of the book "How I rose from the dead in my spare time and so can you", but change his initials to A J (an example of PKD not cross-checking things?). In the crew's polyencephalic world, AJS was a 21st century theologian and is cited as discovering the true nature of the Deity in that world. He specifies five time
periods: the first was the period of purity before the Form Destroyer was awakened; the second is the period of the curse when the Deity was weakest and FD the most powerful; Then there was the birth of God-on-Earth; Currently god walks the world redeeming the suffering now and all life later through the Intercessor; Lastly, there is the period of the Final Audit. PKD defined this theology with William Sarill from Judaism, Christianity, Mohammedism, Zoroastrianism and Tibetian Bhuddism based on the postulate that God Exists. 
</p>
<p> 
<strong>SQUATTERS</strong> (<a href="#55solo">55SOLO</a>)<br />
unauthorised colonists
</p>
<p>
<strong>SQUIB</strong><br />
In 70OFFF, it's a kind of hover car, steered with a tiller and has a boat-like description. In <a href="#70maze">70MAZE</a>, it's a planet-bound flying ship "size B" with an autopilot, that can be guided to land by an RK beam
</p>
<p>
<strong>STIGMATA</strong><br />
In <a href="#65stig">65STIG</a>, The three Stigmata are the physical alterations to Palmer Eldritch's body- metal teeth, Metal eyes with slit-lenses, and a metal arm. Originate in PKD's father's WWI gas mask
</p>
<p>
<strong>STINK OF SHRINK</strong><br />
Non-existent weapon of biological war. Like the BAG PLAGUE, but with the opposite effect "your head diminishes in size, features included, to the circumference of a marble" <a href="#64pent">64PENT</a>

<p>
<strong>SUB-C</strong> (<a href="#55solo">55SOLO</a>)<br />
slower than light.

<p>
<strong>SUPRALOBE</strong> (<a href="#55solo">55SOLO</a>)<br />
Part of the brain that allows telepathy
</p>
<p>
<strong>SWIBBLE</strong><br />
some kind of device to control the 'politically correct behavior' of citizens. It's "an artificially evolved telepathic metazoan." It's purpose was to stop war by ensuring that everyone maintained the same ideology 55SERV. Swibbles are undefined household devices in <a href="#64pent">64PENT</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>SWORD OF CHEMOSH</strong><br />
Tony Dunklewelt obtains this from the Deity through meditation and slays the Form Destroyer with it. But we find that it was Bert Kosler he killed in reality <a href="#70maze">70MAZE</a> 
</p>
<h2><a name="t">T</a></h2>

<strong>TANK</strong><br />

<strong>TEEP</strong> (<a href="#55solo">55SOLO</a>)<br />
telepath
</p>
<p>
<strong>TEEP CORPS</strong> (<a href="#55solo">55SOLO</a>)<br />
part of the Directorate - telepaths. The corps is a family, above man. Teeping is like hearing - if people within range think, you'll pick it up. Teeps all come from San Fransico because during the Final War a soviet missile hit research installations at Livermore - survivours badly BATHED. Teeps are all descendants of Earl and Verna Phillips...teeps find out every strategy devised to beat minimax. Teeps find assassins and make his job very difficult. Have a SUPRALOBE which if destroyed nulls their power. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>TEKKEL UPHARSIM KIBBUTZ</strong><br />
Colony from which Seth Morley and his wife set off for Delmak-O <a href="#70maze">70MAZE</a>. PKD tells us that Tekkel Upharsim means "he has weighed and now they divide" in Aramaic, but I've no idea what the significance of this is. It's a reference to the biblical story of (some king) who saw, literally, the handwriting on the wall. What the hand wrote was "Mene Mene Tekkel Upharsim". I'd be grateful for any further information from any bible-readers out there...
</p>
<p>
<strong>TENCH</strong><br />
Strange creatures which inhabit Delmak-O. The less feeble of which are capable of printing (cf <a href="#56papr">56PAPR</a>) .If a tench prints a pen, the copy decays ("puddles"), but the ink in writing remains ok. Questions to the Grand Tench can be asked by placing pieces of paper in front of it. An answer is exuded from the body on a similar piece of paper (Tench have no vocal organs). Back on the Persus 9, TENCH 889B is the ship's computer <a href="#70maze">70MAZE</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>TERWEP</strong><br />
Weapon of terror (obviously enough) <a href="#67zapg">67ZAPG</a>?
</p>
<p>
<strong>THALAMIC INDEX</strong> (<a href="#55solo">55SOLO</a>)<br />
some sort of telepathic measure of stress

</p>
<p>
<strong>TIRE REGROOVING</strong><br />
Process of using a hot iron to melt deeper grooves into the bodies of already bald tires. Occupation of Nick Appleton in 70OFFF. Outlawed by Gram in this novel.

<strong>TOXILAX ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY</strong><br />
An example of a small thing that isn't a toy in <a href="#70maze">70MAZE</a>. Compared with the mechanical flies and bees that monitor the colonists.

we don't find out what turrets are - but Cartwright worked at a turret factory as a mechanic.
</p>
<h2><a name="u">U</a></h2>
<p>
<strong>UBIK</strong><br />
Ubik itself is a spray to stop objects regressing to a form they had in earlier time, e.g. a TV goes back to a valve radio. Trouble is, Ubik itself regresses to a point where it's magic ingredient isn't there. It's a contraction of ubiquity <a href="#69ubik">69UBIK</a>

</p>
<p> 
<strong>VISRECORD</strong><br />

<strong>WALKER-ON-EARTH</strong><br />
The manifestation of the Deity (in <a href="#70maze">70MAZE</a>) that travels the universe helping folk in the Specktowsky period. He advises Seth Morely that the Morbid Chicken will not get them to Delmak-O. A kind of "anti-person from Porlock, instead of interfering with a good process or event, he..."
</p>
<p>
<strong>WASH-35</strong><br />
The Martian replica of 1935 Washington DC which Kathy Sweetscent's Artiforg-supported boss Virgil Ackerman maintains as a hobby to remember his boyhood. Note that PKD was a small boy in 1935, so Virgil's memories of this time were probably adapted from PKD's.
</p>
<p>
<strong>WES-DEM</strong><br />
Western Democracies? one side in the war that preceded the events in <a href="#64pent">64PENT</a></p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>WUB</strong><br />
An alien/Martian 400lb pig-like organism in 52BWUB. But when killed, it seems to take possession of your mind - so the 400lb pig might just be a victim of the wub. The Wub also appears in 68NOCO, which deals
with a Wub and the Water Union and the power struggle that plays large in 64MATS. Wubs are mentioned but never seen in 69GAPH
</p>
<p>
<strong>WUBFUR</strong><br />
A commonly encountered (sometimes) expensive material (used as mink would be used, I guess). A wub is a creature that invades/takes the form of other creatures 52BWUB, so it shouldn't really have a "fur"...this is a typical PKD in-joke....wubfur is used to make carpets and slippers in <a href="#64pent">64PENT</a>. There's also a short story (Vol 5 I think) in which the Wubfur is used to bind books and the Wubfur alters the text of the book to suit it's idealogical standpoint. So they decide to bind a bible in it. Also found in <a href="#65stig">65STIG</a>.
</p>
<h2><a name="y">Y</a></h2>
<p>
<strong>YAH</strong><br />
(from Yahweh, or Jehovah, "God") The Supreme Being as featured in 81DIVI. A pagan deity who has great plans for a theological overtaking of Earth by appearing on the little planet of CY30-CY30B, secretly impregnating the Terran emigrant Rybys Rommey, instructing her emigrant colleague Herb Asher to marry her and sending them to Earth so that He will be reborn there as a human being (talk about mysterious ways). 
</p>
<p>
<strong>YANCY</strong><br />
